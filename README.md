# SmartContractAuditor

For test run:
1) Clone Repository 
2) Run : npm i, to download all the modules ( you might still need to run: npm install truffle-hdwallet-provider), as sometimes npm i, does not install it.
3) Run: node compile.js. If that does not work, try npx node compile.js. A command prompt should appear asking for the name of file you wish to audit
4) Enter file 'sampleContract'. The command prompt will ask for the level to auditing you wish to carry out, enter 0 or 1.
